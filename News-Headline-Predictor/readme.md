**Financial Review Analyzer** - A Machine Learning Model which predicts a financial review and classifies it as positive opinion(label 1) or a negative/neutral opinion(label 0). Although
                            a binary sentiment analyzer, the dataset used for this project was unlabelled initially since I wished to apply some **unsupervised learning algorithms** for predictions and
                            also due to the lack of labelled text datasets in the area of finance. I have tried out Turney's algorithm, which uses Parts-of-Speech(POS) tags as keywords for  **keyword-based Information
                            Extraction**. The model is still being improved upon, since its an imbalanced dataset aS the F1-score for the underepresented label is low. The project is still ongoing and the repository will be updated at intervals. The model, with some interesting visualizations, is deployed on Streamlit, which is a library utilized for quick deployment of data apps. Due to the lack of **computational resources**, the models have been prepared and trained in **Colaboratory**.
